# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the darrot Discord TTS bot from basic Go flags and environment variable configuration to using Cobra for CLI command handling and Viper for advanced configuration management. This migration will provide a more professional CLI experience with subcommands, better help documentation, and flexible configuration options including support for configuration files, environment variables, and command-line flags with proper precedence.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to use modern CLI patterns with subcommands and comprehensive help, so that I can easily understand and operate the bot with familiar command-line interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs `darrot --help` THEN the system SHALL display comprehensive help information with available commands and global flags
2. WHEN the user runs `darrot version` THEN the system SHALL display version information in a structured format
3. WHEN the user runs `darrot start` THEN the system SHALL start the Discord TTS bot with the same functionality as the current implementation
4. WHEN the user runs `darrot start --help` THEN the system SHALL display help specific to the start command including all available flags
5. WHEN the user provides invalid commands or flags THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages with usage suggestions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want flexible configuration management that supports multiple sources (files, environment variables, CLI flags), so that I can easily configure the bot for different environments and deployment scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration is loaded THEN the system SHALL support configuration from YAML, JSON, and TOML files
2. WHEN configuration is loaded THEN the system SHALL maintain precedence order: CLI flags > environment variables > config file > defaults
3. WHEN configuration is loaded THEN the system SHALL provide sensible default values for all configuration options except sensitive tokens
4. WHEN a config file is specified via `--config` flag THEN the system SHALL load configuration from that file
5. WHEN no config file is specified THEN the system SHALL automatically search for config files in standard locations (./darrot.yaml, ~/.darrot.yaml, /etc/darrot/config.yaml)
6. WHEN environment variables are set THEN the system SHALL override config file values but be overridden by CLI flags
7. WHEN invalid configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL display clear validation error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to validate, inspect, and create configuration files without starting the bot, so that I can troubleshoot configuration issues, verify settings before deployment, and generate configuration templates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs `darrot config validate` THEN the system SHALL validate all configuration sources and report any errors
2. WHEN the user runs `darrot config show` THEN the system SHALL display the effective configuration with sources indicated
3. WHEN the user runs `darrot config show --format json` THEN the system SHALL output configuration in JSON format
4. WHEN the user runs `darrot config create` THEN the system SHALL save the current effective configuration to the default config file location
5. WHEN the user runs `darrot config create --output /path/to/config.yaml` THEN the system SHALL save the configuration to the specified location
6. WHEN configuration validation fails THEN the system SHALL exit with non-zero status and display specific error messages
7. WHEN displaying configuration THEN the system SHALL mask sensitive values like tokens and credentials

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want enhanced CLI features like shell completion and better error handling, so that I can operate the bot more efficiently and troubleshoot issues faster.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs `darrot completion bash` THEN the system SHALL generate bash completion scripts
2. WHEN the user runs `darrot completion zsh` THEN the system SHALL generate zsh completion scripts
3. WHEN the user runs `darrot completion powershell` THEN the system SHALL generate PowerShell completion scripts
4. WHEN invalid arguments are provided THEN the system SHALL suggest similar valid commands or flags
5. WHEN the system encounters errors THEN it SHALL provide actionable error messages with suggested solutions
