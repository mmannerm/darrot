# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive testing framework for the darrot Discord TTS bot that validates both container structure and functional behavior. The framework includes container structure tests to validate the Docker image and acceptance tests that simulate real Discord interactions using a mock Discord API to verify end-to-end functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want container structure tests that validate the Docker image, so that I can ensure the container is properly built with correct dependencies and configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the container structure tests run THEN the system SHALL validate that all required binaries are present in the container
2. WHEN the container structure tests run THEN the system SHALL verify that the Go application binary is executable and has correct permissions
3. WHEN the container structure tests run THEN the system SHALL confirm that required system dependencies (Opus libraries, audio codecs) are installed
4. WHEN the container structure tests run THEN the system SHALL validate that the container exposes no unnecessary ports or services
5. WHEN the container structure tests run THEN the system SHALL verify that the container runs as a non-root user for security

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want acceptance tests that validate bot functionality against a mock Discord API, so that I can verify the bot behaves correctly in realistic scenarios without requiring a real Discord server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN acceptance tests run THEN the system SHALL provide a mock Discord API server that simulates Discord Gateway and REST API endpoints
2. WHEN the bot connects to the mock API THEN the system SHALL verify successful authentication and connection establishment
3. WHEN a mock user sends a darrot-join command THEN the system SHALL validate that the bot attempts to join the specified voice channel
4. WHEN text messages are sent to a monitored channel THEN the system SHALL verify that the bot processes messages and generates TTS audio
5. WHEN the bot generates audio THEN the system SHALL validate that audio data is sent to the mock voice channel
6. WHEN error conditions occur THEN the system SHALL verify that the bot handles errors gracefully and attempts recovery
7. WHEN the bot receives configuration commands THEN the system SHALL validate that settings are properly updated and persisted

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the testing framework to simulate realistic Discord scenarios, so that I can validate complex bot behaviors and edge cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN acceptance tests run THEN the system SHALL simulate multiple users sending messages simultaneously
2. WHEN voice channel scenarios are tested THEN the system SHALL simulate users joining and leaving voice channels
3. WHEN permission scenarios are tested THEN the system SHALL simulate different user roles and permission levels
4. WHEN network scenarios are tested THEN the system SHALL simulate connection drops and reconnection attempts
5. WHEN rate limiting scenarios are tested THEN the system SHALL simulate Discord API rate limits and verify proper handling
6. WHEN the bot processes long messages THEN the system SHALL verify proper message chunking and TTS processing
7. WHEN invalid commands are sent THEN the system SHALL verify appropriate error responses and help messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the testing framework to integrate with CI/CD pipelines, so that container and acceptance tests run automatically on code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CI/CD pipelines run THEN the system SHALL execute container structure tests before acceptance tests
2. WHEN container tests fail THEN the system SHALL prevent acceptance tests from running and fail the build
3. WHEN acceptance tests run THEN the system SHALL provide detailed test reports with pass/fail status for each scenario
4. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate artifacts including test logs and any generated audio samples for debugging
5. WHEN tests run in CI THEN the system SHALL complete within reasonable time limits (under 10 minutes total)
6. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and debugging information
7. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL confirm that the container is ready for deployment

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the testing framework to validate audio processing functionality, so that I can ensure TTS audio generation and Discord voice integration work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TTS audio is generated THEN the system SHALL validate that audio files are in the correct format (Opus/DCA)
2. WHEN audio is processed THEN the system SHALL verify that audio quality settings (speed, volume, voice) are applied correctly
3. WHEN multiple TTS requests are queued THEN the system SHALL validate proper message queuing and processing order
4. WHEN audio playback is simulated THEN the system SHALL verify that audio data is transmitted to the mock voice connection
5. WHEN audio processing fails THEN the system SHALL validate that error recovery mechanisms activate properly
6. WHEN voice settings are changed THEN the system SHALL verify that new settings are applied to subsequent TTS requests
7. WHEN the bot leaves a voice channel THEN the system SHALL validate proper cleanup of audio resources and connections
