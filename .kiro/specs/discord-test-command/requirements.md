# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a basic Discord slash command interaction to the darrot TTS bot, implementing a "/test" command that responds with "Hello World" to verify the bot's Discord integration is working correctly. This serves as a foundational test command to validate the bot's ability to receive and respond to Discord slash commands before implementing more complex TTS functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Discord server administrator, I want to test if the darrot bot is properly connected and responsive, so that I can verify the bot integration before using TTS features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types "/test" in a Discord channel WHERE the darrot bot has access THEN the bot SHALL respond with "Hello World" message
2. WHEN the "/test" command is executed THEN the response SHALL be visible only to the user who executed the command (ephemeral response)
3. WHEN the bot is offline or disconnected THEN the "/test" command SHALL not be available in the Discord command list

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the bot to register slash commands with Discord, so that users can discover and use the "/test" command through Discord's native command interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot starts up THEN it SHALL register the "/test" slash command with Discord's API
2. WHEN a user types "/" in a channel WHERE the bot has access THEN the "/test" command SHALL appear in the autocomplete suggestions
3. IF the command registration fails THEN the bot SHALL log an error message and continue running

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when using the "/test" command, so that I know the bot is working correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the "/test" command is successfully executed THEN the bot SHALL respond within 3 seconds
2. WHEN the "/test" command response is sent THEN it SHALL include the text "Hello World"
3. IF the bot encounters an error processing the command THEN it SHALL respond with a user-friendly error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling for the Discord command interaction, so that the bot remains stable and provides useful debugging information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Discord API error occurs during command execution THEN the bot SHALL log the error details
2. WHEN the bot lacks permissions to respond to a command THEN it SHALL log a permission error
3. IF the Discord connection is lost during command processing THEN the bot SHALL attempt to reconnect and log the connection status
