# Product Overview

**darrot** is a Discord Parrot Text-to-Speech (TTS) AI application that listens to Discord chat channels and converts text messages to speech.

## Development Principle
**Always aim for the simplest possible end result when making any changes.** Complexity should only be added when it directly solves a real problem and provides clear value.

## Core Functionality
