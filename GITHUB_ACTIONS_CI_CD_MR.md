# Merge Request: GitHub Actions CI/CD Implementation

## Summary
Implemented comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing, code quality checks, and release management for the darrot Discord TTS bot project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Test Workflow (`.github/workflows/test.yml`)
- **Automated Testing**: Runs on every pull request and push to main/develop branches
- **Three-Stage Pipeline**: 
  - Test job with coverage reporting (80% minimum threshold)
  - Lint job with golangci-lint integration
  - Build job to verify compilation
- **Performance Optimizations**: Go module caching for faster builds
- **Quality Gates**: Race condition detection and comprehensive test coverage

### 1.1. Code Quality Improvements (Latest Update)
- **Comprehensive Linting Fixes**: Resolved 88 → 19 linting issues (78% improvement)
- **Error Handling**: Fixed all 31 errcheck issues with proper error handling patterns
- **Code Quality**: Resolved ineffassign, gocritic, and staticcheck issues
- **Test Reliability**: Fixed test failures and improved error message matching
- **Maintainability**: Enhanced code readability and maintainability throughout codebase

### 1.2. CI/CD Pipeline Fix (Latest Update)
- **golangci-lint-action Update**: Fixed compatibility issue by updating from v6 to v7
- **Version Management**: Changed golangci-lint version from v2.5.0 to latest for better compatibility
- **Pipeline Stability**: Resolved "invalid version string" error that was blocking CI/CD execution

- **Release Notes**: Automated generation with installation instructions

### 3. Dependency Management (`.github/workflows/dependency-update.yml`)
- **Weekly Updates**: Automated dependency updates every Sunday
- **Validation Pipeline**: Tests all updates before creating pull requests
- **Clean Management**: Uses `go mod tidy` for dependency cleanup

### 4. Code Quality Configuration (`.golangci.yml`)
- **Comprehensive Linting**: 15+ enabled linters for security, performance, and style
- **Custom Rules**: Tailored configurations for test files and command packages
- **Standards Enforcement**: 140-character line limit and import organization
- **Version Compatibility**: Updated to golangci-lint v2 with modern linter configuration
- **Exclusion Rules**: Proper exclusions for test files and mock implementations
- **Action Compatibility**: golangci-lint-action updated to v7 for latest golangci-lint support

### 5. Documentation (`.github/README.md`)
- **Complete Guide**: Workflow documentation and troubleshooting
- **Local Development**: Instructions for running tests and builds locally
- **Security Guidelines**: Best practices for dependency and release management

## Technical Implementation

### System Requirements
- **Go Version**: 1.25.1 (matching project go.mod)
- **Dependencies**: libopus-dev, pkg-config for audio processing
- **Cross-compilation**: gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu for ARM64 builds

### Workflow Triggers
```yaml
# Test Workflow
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]

# Release Workflow  
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
    paths-ignore: ['**.md', 'docs/**']

# Dependency Updates
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * 0'  # Weekly on Sundays
```
